I was long curious about how does λ calculus become the foundation of formalizaing programming languages. It's strange that I haven't look up the answer until today: It's invented so early by Alonzo Church (whom I will write another post for) as an alternative mathematic foundation in 1930s and its relation with programming language was re-discoverred in 1960s.

From the "Lambda calculus and programming languages" section of wikipedia page:

> As pointed out by Peter Landin's 1965 paper "A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation"

I found this name quite familiar since I read his paper "The mechanical evaluation of expressions" before, in which he introduced the first abstract machine for functional programming language, namely [SECD machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine). This paper also define the term [Closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) which becomes a prevalent notion in computer programming nowadays.
